# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Footer status lists the paths of unique rules loaded in the current session.
- Dynamic rule-injection output now includes the active-rule list for `Ctrl+O` expansion.
- Matcher cache reset and stats helpers for deterministic cache verification.

### Changed

- Footer paths now use short, distinct suffixes when rules share the same relative path.
- Glob matching now reuses a bounded compiled matcher cache instead of recompiling picomatch patterns for every file.
- Dynamic rule loading now deduplicates repeated target paths and rule-file parsing work.

### Fixed

- Documented `PI_RULES_DISABLED`, `PI_RULES_MAX_RULE_CHARS`, and `PI_RULES_MAX_RESULT_CHARS` environment variables are now read at extension registration; previously nothing in `src/` consulted `process.env`, so setting them had no effect.
- Dynamic rule injection now dedupes by rule across the session instead of per tool call, preventing repeated nested `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` instruction blocks on subsequent reads.
- Dynamic dedup is now truly session-scoped: the cache key no longer includes the first target path, so a rule that matches many files injects once per session instead of once per distinct file.
- Dynamic injection now skips rules already injected statically or already loaded by pi's native context loader.
- Dynamic rule loading now preserves each target file's project root so nested projects load their nearest rules correctly.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- Initial pi coding-agent extension that injects rules into the agent's system prompt and tool results.
- Rule discovery from `.omo/rules/`, `.claude/rules/`, `.cursor/rules/`, `.github/instructions/`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, plus user-home equivalents.
- YAML frontmatter parser supporting `description`, `globs`, `paths` (Claude alias), `applyTo` (Copilot alias), `alwaysApply`.
- Glob matcher with picomatch, normalization of all glob aliases.
- Walk-up project rule discovery from cwd to project root with deterministic precedence ordering.
- In-memory deduplication via realPath + SHA-256 content hash, scoped per session for static and per toolCallId for dynamic.
- `before_agent_start` hook for static rule injection (only `single-file` and `alwaysApply` rules).
- `tool_result` hook for dynamic per-file rule injection on `read`, `edit`, `write` tool results.
- `session_start` hook to reset state and audit via `pi.appendEntry("pi-rules.scan", ...)`.
- Plain-text injection format with `Instructions from: <path>` prefix (opencode style).
- Char-budget truncation: 12,000 per rule, 40,000 per tool result, configurable via env vars.
- TUI banner widget shown on session start (component-based, dismissed on first `before_agent_start`).
- Persistent status line via `ctx.ui.setStatus("pi-rules", text)`.
- Slash commands: `/rules`, `/rules list`, `/rules show <id>`, `/rules paths`, `/rules status`, `/reload-rules`.
- CLI flags: `pi-rules-disabled`, `pi-rules-mode` (`static`/`dynamic`/`both`/`off`), `pi-rules-widget`.
- Dedup against pi-mono native context loader via `event.systemPromptOptions.contextFiles`.
- 229 unit tests + 43 integration tests against a realistic sample-project fixture.
- MIT-licensed source with NOTICE clarifying omo (SUL-1.0) inspiration.
